## A melon is any of various plants of the family Cucurbitaceae with sweet edible, fleshy fruit.



The word "melon" can refer to either the plant or specifically to the fruit. Botanically, a melon is a kind of berry, specifically a "pepo".

The Thing with melons is that they love lemons as they balance out each other in life. Once little squeeze and they are happy forever

Some change here!
